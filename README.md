# react-flux-mui

A work in progress attempt to provide a Haskell binding to the [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) JavaScript library that integrates with [react-flux](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/react-flux).

Material-UI components can already be accessed by using`react-flux`'s [foreign\_](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/react-flux-1.2.3/docs/React-Flux-Combinators.html#v:foreign_) combinator. This however still requires:

- defining a new combinator for each component
- exposing the component as a top-level JavaScript `window` property
- and with direct usage of `foreign_` there is no type checking of properties fed to the compontent

The goal of this library is to address those points by generating the combinators, providing records for specifying the properties and creating suitable JavaScript file exposing the components.

---

The code of the binding is automatically generated by parsing output of [react-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen) on Material-UI.

At this time the output of the generator compiles successfully but it's not in a usable state yet.

## Directory structure

- `./gen` - the code generator itself
- `./react-flux-mui` - the actual, automatically generated Haskell package of the binding
- `./react-flux-mui/js` - various support JavaScript files

## Generating the binding

Generating the binding requires [nix package manager](http://nixos.org/nix/). nix ensures all required dependencies are provided and builds the code generator.

To regenerate the binding:

```
$ cd gen
$ ./gen
```

## TODO items:

- [x] clean up the output of the generator to ensure the generated code doesn't produce any compilation warnings
- [ ] clean up the code of the generator itself
- [ ] create a wrapper function for the components to set up a theme provider
- [ ] provide documentation on the usage of the library and possibly for the generated code
