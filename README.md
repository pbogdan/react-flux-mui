# react-flux-mui

A work in progress attempt to provide a Haskell binding to the [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) JavaScript library that integrates with [react-flux](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/react-flux).

The code of the binding is automatically generated by parsing output of [react-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen) on Material-UI.

At this time the output of the generator compiles successfully but it's not in a usable state yet.

## Directory structure

- `./gen` - the code generator itself
- `./react-flux-mui` - the actual, automatically generated Haskell package of the binding
- `./react-flux-mui/js` - various support JavaScript files

## Generating the binding

Generating the binding requires [nix package manager](http://nixos.org/nix/). nix ensures all required dependencies are provided and builds the code generator.

To regenerate the binding:

```
$ cd gen
$ ./gen
```

## TODO items:

- clean up the output of the generator to ensure the generated code doesn't produce any compilation warnings
- clean up the code of the generator itself
- create a wrapper function for the components to set up a theme provider
- provide documentation on the usage of the library and possibly for the generated code
